# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and the project follows Semantic
Versioning.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.10] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Added `getSparkRendererForScene` and `updateSharedSparkRendererOptions`
  public exports for inspecting the shared Spark renderer and updating supported
  Spark renderer options at runtime.

### Changed

- Made runtime shared Spark renderer option updates apply without logging the
  shared-options warning.
- Avoided recursively cloning camera children when reusing camera-relative Spark
  update and render cameras.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- Added `premultipliedAlpha` to the supported `sparkRendererOptions` subset.
- Reduced camera-relative Spark renderer hot-path overhead by removing unused
  traversal state, limiting rebased-root pool cleanup to the previous frame's
  active range, and restoring rebased root matrices in a single pass.
- Clarified the Spark accumulator timing assumption used when fixing
  camera-relative `viewToWorld` state after an update.
- Removed `accumExtSplats` from the supported `sparkRendererOptions` subset
  and documentation because Spark's default packed accumulator already encodes
  intermediary splats relative to the camera origin.

### Fixed

- Applied shared `depthTest` and `depthWrite` option updates to the Spark
  material instead of the renderer object.
- Cleared pending Spark update/sort timers and splat state before shared Spark
  renderer disposal, and deferred final disposal while an active sort is still
  completing.
- Updated the shared example viewer to listen for the current
  `load-tileset` event name.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-05-21

### Changed

- Updated the Spark peer and development dependency range to `^2.1.0`.
- Updated the 3D Tiles Renderer peer and development dependency range to
  `^0.4.25`.
- Updated the documentation and example imagery globe setup to use
  `GeneratedSurfacePlugin` with `XYZTilesOverlay` instead of deprecated
  image-format plugin APIs.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Camera-relative Spark updates now reuse Spark's internal auto-update skip
  logic while still updating with the identity-rebased camera used by the
  plugin.
- Simplified camera-relative root traversal to carry ancestor state during the
  visible scene walk, avoiding repeated parent-chain scans and explicit
  splat/edit state snapshots in the render path.
- Constrained the Spark peer and development dependency range to `~2.0.0`.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Preserved WebXR `ArrayCamera.matrixWorld` during camera-relative Spark update
  checks by reading the camera pose directly from `matrixWorld` instead of
  calling Three.js world-pose helpers that recompute the matrix.

### Changed

- Documented the WebXR camera/session switching pattern with a VRButton-based
  example aligned with the upstream 3D Tiles Renderer VR example.
- Clarified that AR needs its own placement, hit-test, reference-space, depth,
  and occlusion handling in addition to the 3D Tiles XR camera pattern.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-05-03

### Fixed

- Rebased Spark global `SplatEdit` roots alongside camera-relative Gaussian
  splat roots and tracked edit/SDF state changes so crop boxes stay aligned and
  refresh correctly when edited.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-22

### Added

- Added optional `sparkRendererOptions` on the `GaussianSplatPlugin` host so
  callers can forward a supported subset of Spark renderer settings into the
  shared camera-relative Spark renderer.

### Changed

- Shared Spark renderer setup now normalizes tracked option values and keeps
  `focalAdjustment: 2` as the plugin default while leaving other unspecified
  settings on Spark defaults.
- When multiple `GaussianSplatPlugin` instances reuse the same `Scene` /
  `WebGLRenderer` pair, explicit `sparkRendererOptions` from later instances
  are merged into the existing shared renderer instead of being ignored.

### Fixed

- Avoided dirtying the shared Spark renderer when a later plugin instance
  repeats the renderer's current option value for a key that was not previously
  tracked by the manager.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- Updated camera-relative Spark invalidation to snapshot Gaussian splat world
  transforms and opacity, so rebased splat movement now triggers a refresh.
- Continued the Spark update check for one frame after rebasing ends, which
  prevents stale accumulation state when camera-relative splats disappear.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed

- Updated camera-relative Spark invalidation to track Gaussian splat node
  state, not just UUID presence, so opacity changes and GaussianSplatScene-only
  visibility changes correctly trigger a refresh.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

- Corrected the package repository, homepage, and issue tracker URLs to match
  the actual GitHub repository so npm metadata and trusted publishing resolve
  against the right repo.
- Added an npm publish workflow for tag-based releases and updated it to use
  `npm publish --access public`.
- Upgraded the publish workflow to use Node.js 24 and npm 11.10.0+ so Trusted
  Publishing runs against a supported CLI/runtime combination.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Initial public npm release for `3d-tiles-rendererjs-3dgs-plugin`.
- Gaussian splat tile parsing for `gltf` and `glb` payloads that use
  `KHR_gaussian_splatting` with
  `KHR_gaussian_splatting_compression_spz_2`.
- Rendering support for both explicit and implicit 3D Tiles tiling schemes.
- Shared Spark renderer management, camera-relative rebasing, byte accounting,
  and fade-plugin-compatible opacity handling.
- Browser demo and sample datasets for explicit and implicit tilesets.
